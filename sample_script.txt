Hello team, and welcome to our weekly sync-up.

First, let's talk about the quarterly report. Alice will need to finalize the Q3 report and send it out for review.

Next, regarding the marketing campaign, the main task is to prepare the presentation slides for next Tuesday.

Finally, a quick reminder for everyone: the final project deadline is 2025-09-15. Please make sure all your deliverables are submitted by then.

That's all for today. Thank you.
